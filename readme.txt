Description: 

To compile and run the coverart.c program provided, you just need to run "gcc coverart.c -lglut -lGL". I tested and ran the code in open-gpus server and it worked fine over there.

Make sure to run "export MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=3.3" before executing the executable file.

To compile and run the program, you will need to run the following:- tasm bricks- tlink bricks util_br- bricks
